    <article>
        <p>I am a PhD student at the Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf supervised by Stefan Harmeling. 
           My studies focus on solving phase retrieval problems using deep neural networks but moreover I am enthusiastic about everything that involves pixels and machine learning. </p>
